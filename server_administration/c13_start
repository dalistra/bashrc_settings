Systemlogging:
rsyslog
systemd
journalctl

rsync -avl --delete dir1 dir2                 option l(copy symbolic links) is maybe redundant with option a
sftp      scp     ssh       

SSH Key authorization
ssh-keygen          generate a ssh keypair(private and public) optional passwort for private key
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub dalistra@HOST_IP_ADRESS
dalistra@HOST_IP_ADRESS's password:

LOGGING:
rsyslog is the daemon for logging its most important configuration file is /etc/rsyslog.conf 
journalctl will show log messages directly from systemd journal ???
/etc/rsyslog.d/         will set which log messages go in which log file and which importancy the message must have to be logged

Logging message structure
date and time that the message was logged
name of the computer from which the message came
program or service name to which the message pertains
process number (enclosed in square brackets) of the program sending the message
actual text message

!!!!!MUST BE BOLD!!!!  ????????    send logging to a remote logging host add /etc/rsyslog.conf
CLIENT /etc/rsyslog.conf
authpriv.*                      @hostIPadress:port
mail.*                          @hostIPadress:port

HOST /etc/rsyslog.conf  uncomment following rows or only UDP or TCP as needed
module(load="imudp") # needs to be done just once
input(type="imudp" port="514")
module(load="imtcp") # needs to be done just once
input(type="imtcp" port="514")

after this restart the service        systemctl restart rsyslog
# netstat -tupln | grep 514         to check if the service is listening to the port

Logwatch      apt install logwatch      log summarize with optional daily email of most important messages
mailutils package is needed if the mail shall work properly apt install mailutils
logwatch service runs from a cron (0logwatch) placed in /etc/cron.daily.
/etc/logwatch/conf/logwatch.conf holds local settings.
default options used to gather log messages are available in the
/usr/share/logwatch/default.conf/logwatch.conf file
(you can easily copy the file to your /etc/logwatch/conf/ directory).

# mail    if you want to see the mail message on the local system


sar command for monitoring system resources
part of the sysstat package maybe you need to apt install sysstat
change /etc/default/sysstat       ENABLED="false" to ENABLED="true"
and start the service
# systemclt enable sysstat
# systemctl start sysstat

# sar -u      for seeing CPU usage for example will function if the logging is going on for some time
# sar -d      disk usage
# sar -n DEV 5 2      network usage every 5 seconds repeated twice??
sar, sadc, sa1, and sa2 man pages are related


df -h     disk free     -h for human readable
du -h     disk used     same as above
Add â€“s to see total disk space used for a directory and its subdirectories.
