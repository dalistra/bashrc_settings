(parted) p            list the partitions
(parted) rm           remove partitions
(parted) mklabel gpt      relabel the partition table to gpt
(parted) mkpart       create an partition with a name a file system and a start and end point on the disk
(parted) p            list the partitions and check again if the process was done correctly
(parted) quit         quit to quit parted

mkfs -t xfs /dev/sd*NUMBER    create a filesystem on the partition  there are other possible commands such as mkfs.ext4

mkdir /mnt/test           create dir
mount /dev/sd*NUMBER /mnt/test    mount the disk to /mnt/test
df -h /mnt/test           show info about the mountpoint

umount /dev/sd*NUMBER     to unmount the disk

/etc/fstab    is a file which holds mountpoints and will mount them automatically at the system boot
you can add for example /dev/sdb1 /mnt/test xfs defaults 0 1      to the file to mount sdb1 at system start
        xfs is the filesystem and defaults are the options used first 0 is for backup  dump command and second 1 will check the disk health after #Mounts
