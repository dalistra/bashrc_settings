Another way to work with your history list is to use the fc command. Type fc followed by
a history line number, and that command line is opened in your default text editor. Make
the changes that you want. When you exit the editor, the command runs. You can also give
a range of line numbers (for example, fc 100 105). All of the commands open in your text
editor and then run one after the other when you exit the editor.

Ctrl+R Reverse incremental search   After you press these keys, you enter a search string
to do a reverse search. As you type the string, a matching command line appears that you can

forward search. (It may not work in all instances.)
Alt+P Reverse search After you press these keys, you enter a string to do
a reverse search. Type a string and press Enter to see the most recent command line that includes
