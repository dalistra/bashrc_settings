Permissions
chmod XXX option -R for recursively      - 4 read 2 write 1 execute sum of the wanted permission is X. 1 X is user 2nd is group third is for other users
                exception is s and t: s will set the user or group which will be used to run the executable and t will alow other users to place data
                in the directory, but they cannot delete or modify data from other users.
chmod augo +rwx or -rwx FILE       - will add or remove (r)ead (w)rite e(x)ecute for the (g)roup, (u)ser, (o)thers or (a)ll
                example: chmod ug -xw to remove write and execute for user and group
                         chmod a +rw to add read and write to all
this command ist better for recursively change permissions than the number variant
umask sets the standard permission for new file/folder umask 0XXX where the X are like the chmod XXX but 7-X so 000 is rwxrwxrwx and 777 is ---------

change owner of file or dir use -R for recursively is an option
chown dalistra FILE or chown dalistra:dalistra FILE
