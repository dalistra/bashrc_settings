# bashrc_settings

I will collect some custom commands for the Linux/Ubuntu Server Setup.

For the beginning there are primarily commands to customize the command promt and color codes in the ls command.
Additionally there is an alias for pwd and ls in combination and a PATH extension to look for executable files.
