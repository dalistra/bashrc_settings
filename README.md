# bashrc_settings

I will collect some custom commands for the Linux/Ubuntu Server.
For the beginning there are especialy commands to customize the command promt and color codes in the ls command.
Additionaly there is an alias for pwd and ls in combination and a PATH extension to look for executable files.
